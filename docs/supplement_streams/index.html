# C&#43;&#43; Streams
## Supplement

---

## The Streams You Know

### `std::cin` and `std::cout`

You are already familliar with the _standard input_ and _standard output_ streams (`cin` and `cout`, respectively).  But, you may not have considered much beyond the simplest basics about how they work.

This supplement will talk about how C&#43;&#43; supports a whole _family_ of streams and stream-like objects, and how they work on a conceptual level that may help you when you run into confusion with stream-processing tasks.

---

## The Stream You May Not

In addition to `cin` and `cout`, there is also a stream designed to communicate error messages out of your programs!  This one is named `std::cerr`, and it is the _standard error_ stream.  It behaves exactly like `cout` except that its output can be routed differently at the OS level:

``` {.cpp}
std::cerr &lt;&lt; &#34;This is an error message.&#34; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
```

---

## File Streams

You have probably also seen streams attached to files, opened in &#34;character mode&#34; (also known as &#34;text mode&#34;):

``` {.cpp}
std::ifstream input_file_stream { &#34;your_input_file.txt&#34; };
std::ofstream output_file_stream { &#34;your_output_file.txt&#34; };
```

These streams behave exactly like their console I/O counterparts, except that the &#34;other end&#34; of the stream is attached to a file, whose name is specified when you open the stream.

---

## What does a stream look like?

When you imagine what a stream looks like (from the point-of-view of your program), what do you imagine?

Character-encoded streams are &#34;seen&#34; by the program as a series of characters (type `char`) and a _position_ in that series of characters that serves as a marker of the &#34;current location&#34;.

Imagine a series of blocks with a character on each, stretching in a row off into the distance.  As you walk along this path of character blocks, _you_ are the &#34;current location&#34; marker.  Each time you walk past a block, it essentially fades into the &#34;past&#34; as far as you are concerned, and there are more character blocks ahead that you will walk by in &#34;the future&#34;.

---


Let&#39;s visualize this as it exists in memory (more or less):

``` {.txt}
--------------------------------------------------------------------
|H|e|l|l|o| |W|o|r|l|d|!|\n|T|h|i|s| |i|s| |a| |s|t|r|e|a|m| |.|.|.|
--------------------------------------------------------------------
             ^
```

The caret (arrow) below the stream indicates the current position. The current position typically only moves &#34;forward&#34; (to the right in the figure).  It is possible to go back in some cases, though.

---

## Time is Relative

&lt;img src=&#39;../images/shared/yellow_brick_road.jpg&#39; style=&#39; max-height: 500px; float: right;&#39; /&gt;

Here&#39;s where it can get confusing.  From a stream&#39;s point-of-view, there is no end to this row of characters (as long as the stream is open).  

Although you might walk to a position where you don&#39;t see any more blocks in front of you _now_, more may appear at any moment.

If new characters appear, you can continue walking along the stream.



---

You have observed this effect every time you&#39;ve prompted the user to enter some keyboard input.  Like this:

``` {.cpp}
int x;
cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Enter an integer: &#34;;
cin  &gt;&gt; x;
cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Great!\n&#34;;
```

This code will appear to &#34;stop and wait&#34; on the line beginning with `cin` until the user types some characters and presses `&lt;ENTER&gt;`.  

From the program&#39;s standpoint, it is just waiting for the stream to increase in length so that it can &#34;walk&#34; along it further.  When the user pressed `&lt;ENTER&gt;`, more characters appeared and the walk continued.

---

File streams are different from user input -- all of the data that will exist in the file is (usually) _already there_ when the file is opened.

Imagine you want to read three integers:

``` {.cpp}
int a, b, c;
input_file_stream &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c;
```

---

``` {.cpp}
int a, b, c;
input_file_stream &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c;
```

This works fine, assuming the file looks like this:

``` {.txt}
5
12
17
```

Or, even this:

``` {.txt}
5 12 17
```

---

From the moment the stream is _opened_ (from your program&#39;s point-of-view), **all** of the input is already in the stream!

``` {.txt}
----------------------
|5| |1|2| |1|7|\n|EOF|
----------------------
 ^
```
The streams position is initially at the start.  As the stream extraction operator sees characters matching the signature of an `int`, it &#34;walks&#34; the stream to the right, until a whitespace.  

---

After `a` is extracted (the 5 is read), the stream will look like this:

``` {.txt}
----------------------
|5| |1|2| |1|7|\n|EOF|
----------------------
   ^
```

The stream&#39;s position is at the first space character.  (The stream extraction operator does not &#34;remove&#34; the delimiter, meaning it doesn&#39;t walk past it.)

---

Now let&#39;s consider a different case.  We want to read an ID number (integer) followed by a full name (which will contain spaces).  We might do this:

``` {.cpp}
int id;
std::string name;
input_file_stream &gt;&gt; id;
getline(input_file_stream, name);
cout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &#34; is ID number &#34; &lt;&lt; id &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;;
```

Let&#39;s assume an input file like this:

``` {.txt}
324
Alice Sanders
```

---


``` {.txt}
324
Alice Sanders
```

The input will **fail** to do what we _want_.  (You should expect it though, if you&#39;ve used `getline()` before...)  Here&#39;s the code again:

``` {.cpp}
int id;
std::string name;
input_file_stream &gt;&gt; id;
getline(input_file_stream, name);
cout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &#34; is ID number &#34; &lt;&lt; id &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;;
```

The output would be:

``` {.txt}
 is ID number 324
```

Where did the name go?

---

## The name is in the future.

That&#39;s right -- the name is still in the stream&#39;s &#34;future&#34;.  Let&#39;s look at the stream.  Here it is at the moment we open the file:

``` {.txt}
---------------------------------------
|3|2|4|\n|A|l|i|c|e| |S|a|n|d|e|r|s|\n|
---------------------------------------
 ^
```

We do `input\_file\_stream &gt;&gt; id;`.  Now the stream is:

``` {.txt}
---------------------------------------
|3|2|4|\n|A|l|i|c|e| |S|a|n|d|e|r|s|\n|
---------------------------------------
       ^
```

The stream extraction operator **_doesn&#39;t walk past the delimiter_**.

---

``` {.txt}
---------------------------------------
|3|2|4|\n|A|l|i|c|e| |S|a|n|d|e|r|s|\n|
---------------------------------------
       ^
```

Now we do `getline(input\_file\_stream, name);`.

The first thing in the stream is the `\n`, which is the delimiter for `getline()`, so it happily _removes_ the delimiter and stops.  It didn&#39;t read anything useful, so the name remains empty.  The stream is:

``` {.txt}
---------------------------------------
|3|2|4|\n|A|l|i|c|e| |S|a|n|d|e|r|s|\n|
---------------------------------------
          ^
```

---

This is why we have to use `ignore()` when mixing stream extraction operators and `getline()`.  We have to walk past anything that looks like a delimiter.

This code is correct:

``` {.cpp}
int id;
std::string name;
input_file_stream &gt;&gt; id;
input_file_stream.ignore(std::numeric_limits&lt;std::streamsize&gt;::max(), &#39;\n&#39;);
getline(input_file_stream, name);
cout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &#34; is ID number &#34; &lt;&lt; id &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;;
```

`ignore()` will &#34;keep walking&#34; until it sees the `\n` or the end of the stream&#39;s current content.  

---

`ignore()` will &#34;keep walking&#34; until it sees the `\n` or the end of the stream&#39;s current content.  It will walk past the delimiter too, so after the `ignore` call, the stream would look like:

``` {.txt}
---------------------------------------
|3|2|4|\n|A|l|i|c|e| |S|a|n|d|e|r|s|\n|
---------------------------------------
          ^
```

That&#39;s perfect for the `getline()`.  

But **we only needed to do this because the** `&gt;&gt;` **left the delimiter in our path**.  Don&#39;t assume you always need to use `ignore()`.  You have to think about what the stream actually looks like.

---

## Streams can go bad...

Whenever we try to operate on a stream, but the stream is unable to complete the operation successfully, the stream can &#34;go bad&#34;.  This actually isn&#39;t a single condition, but three:

* The &#34;bad&#34; bit is set.
  * Read/writing error on i/o operation.
* The &#34;EOF&#34; bit is set.
  * End-of-File was reached on input operation.
* The &#34;fail&#34; bit is set.
  * Logical error on i/o operation.

\(Ref: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ios/ios/good/ \)

---

## Check for bad streams...

It is easy to check for these &#34;bad&#34; stream conditions.  There are four stream methods you should keep in mind:

* `good()` : Returns `true` if none of the failure indicator bits are set, indicating the stream is &#34;good&#34; and ready for use.
* `eof()` : Returns `true` if the &#34;eof&#34; bit is set.  Cannot read from a stream in this condition.  Attempts to do so also set the &#34;fail&#34; bit.
* `bad()` : Returns `true` if the &#34;bad&#34; bit is set.  Most stream operations will fail while this condition is present.  May not be recoverable.
* `fail()` : Returns `true` if the &#34;fail&#34; or the &#34;bad&#34; bit is set.  May be able to resume operation after a `clear()`.

---

## We can clean up a bad stream.

If the stream has failed due to an operation like trying to read an integer when the next value in the stream was a string, or reading at the end of file, we can clear the state flags and restore the stream to a &#34;good&#34; state with the `clear()` method.

---

**Example**

File:

``` {.txt}
Hello 42
```

Code:

```{.cpp}
int x;
std::string msg;
input_file_stream &gt;&gt; x;         // will fail; a string is first in the file.
if(!input_file_stream.good()){
    cerr &lt;&lt; &#34;Stream error... trying again.&#34; &lt;&lt; endl;
    input_file_stream.clear();  // clears the fail bit.
}
input_file_stream &gt;&gt; msg;       // works; a string is there.
input_file_stream &gt;&gt; x;         // works now, an int is the next token
cout &lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; &#34; &#34; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
```
