## Trees
### Featuring: The Binary Search Tree
#### (Ch 20)

## Trees
In the computer science sense, trees are simply non-linear linked structures where each node may link to two or more other nodes, in a _hierarchical_ fashion.

* The entry point into a tree is called the _**root**_.
* Trees are (usually) drawn &#34;upside down&#34;, with the root at the top.
* Normally, we don’t draw the NULL pointers when we draw a tree... but we must remember that they are there.

## Trees
We use terms borrowed from family trees to describe the hierarchical relationships between nodes in CS trees.&lt;br /&gt;  (parent, child, grandparent, sibling, etc.)

* Interior nodes – have at least one child
* Leaf nodes – have no children
* Edge - A non-null outgoing link from a node to its child node.
* Height - Longest path along edges from root to any leaf, plus one.
    - (The empty tree is height 0, a single node is height 1)
* Subtree - any node in the tree, and all its descendents.

## Binary Trees

A _binary tree_ is a tree in which each node has up to two children.

* These are the most common type
* Easy to design and conceptualize (and code)
* Useful in many contexts
* The order of the values may or may not matter.

---

## Binary Search Trees

A _Binary Search Tree_ is a binary tree that has the following additional properties: 

* From any node in the tree, the left child (if non-null) has a smaller value than the parent.
* From any node in the tree, the right child (if non-null) has a larger value than the parent.

As the name implies, Binary Search Trees are optimized for searching.

## Binary Search Trees

* Order of data addition affects efficiency.
    - “Random” arrival
    - Non-random (partially ordered) arrival
    - Discuss best, average, worst cases.

## Code examples

* Add items
* Search for items
* Traversals
    - In-order
    - pre-order
    - post-order
* Remove items
